    <p class="project-subtitle">PyTorch • Multi30k • Full encoder–decoder architecture</p>
    <p class="project-description">
      Implemented a full Transformer model from scratch in PyTorch, including
      multi-head attention, positional encodings, custom tokenizers, and a training
      loop on the Multi30k dataset. Focused on reproducing “Attention is All You Need”
      details and understanding every component end-to-end.
