# Personal

I'm a <span style="color:#FDB515 !important; font-weight:bold;">UC</span><span style="color:#003262 !important; font-weight:bold;"> Berkeley</span> student studying CS. I'm currently doing Agentic AI research with Professors [Joey Gonzalez](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jegonzal/) and [Alex Dimakis](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alexdimakis/) at <a href="https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">
  <span style="color:#FDB515 !important; font-weight:bold;">Sky</span><span style="color:#003262 !important; font-weight:bold;">Lab</span>
</a>, mainly analyzing tool use within agents. My interests broadly span most things ML, primarily LLM's and Optimization, whether they are used for finance, robotics, vision applications, etc.
